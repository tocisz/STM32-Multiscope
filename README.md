# Multi-Scope
Project from [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Fast-Portable-and-Affordable-Oscilloscope-and-Indu/) by VÃ­tor Barbosa.

## Project continued in different repo

I found that Vitor code is based on STM32-O-Scope, so I forked that repo and rebased code. Please [go there](https://github.com/tocisz/STM32-O-Scope).
